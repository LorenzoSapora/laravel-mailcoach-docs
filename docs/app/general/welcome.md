Welcome to the Mailcoach app documentation! These pages are here to guide you through your setup and management of your Mailcoach dashboard.

There are three ways of installing Mailcoach.

1. If you already have a Laravel 8 application, you can install Mailcoach as a package inside it. Head over to the [package installation instructions](/docs/v3/package/general/installation-and-setup) to continue.

2. If you have no experience with Laravel or PHP, the easiest way to get started is our 1-click-installer. This installer will provision a new server at Digital Ocean, install Mailcoach as a standalone application and all its dependencies on it.

3. If you have experience with Laravel and PHP, and want to use Mailcoach as a standalone application, you can [use composer to create a new Laravel project with Mailcoach preinstalled](https://mailcoach.app/docs/v3/app/installation/using-composer).
